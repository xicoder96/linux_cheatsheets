# Linux Containers

## What's a Linux Container ?

- A Linux container is a set of one or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. 
- All the files necessary to run them are provided from a distinct image - Linux containers are portable and consistent as they move from development, to testing, and finally to production.
